# K-mean clustering using the scikit-learn python libraries

**The goal of this was to use another clustering tool and apply it to the same features used in the GoM**

Code stolen from: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-kmeans-silhouette-analysis-py

Modified to take in phenotypic information as used in the GoM method
